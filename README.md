![HR Analytics](https://i.ibb.co/yF463Cg/Screenshot-120.png)

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI project that focuses on the analysis of road accidents. The project aims to provide insights into the current year's accidents, year-over-year (YoY) growth of accidents, accidents by vehicle type (car, bike, trucks), accidents in dry and wet conditions, and geographic visualization of accidents using latitude and longitude data.

## Introduction
Road accidents are a significant concern, and this Power BI project aims to help stakeholders, including government agencies, law enforcement, and safety organizations, better understand accident patterns and trends. By analyzing the data, we can make informed decisions to improve road safety.

## Project Files
- **Road Accident Analysis.pbix**: The main Power BI report file containing all visualizations and data connections.
- **Road Accident Data.xlsx**: This file contains the raw data used for the analysis.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Accidents Overview Dashboard**: Provides an overview of accidents for the current year and compares it to the previous year's data.
2. **Vehicle Type Analysis**: Analyzes accidents by different vehicle types (e.g., car, bike, trucks) to identify trends.
3. **Weather Conditions Analysis**: Examines accidents in dry and wet conditions to understand the impact of weather on accidents.
4. **Date Calendar**: A date table used for time-based analysis and filtering.
5. **Geographic Visualization**: Utilizes latitude and longitude data to create a map visualization that shows accident hotspots.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vibhu110602/Road-Accident-Analysis
   ```
2. Open the Road Accident Analysis.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Customize the data source connections, if needed, to point to your data files or data source.
4. Refresh the data to update the analysis with the latest data.
5. Explore the visualizations and gain insights from the analysis.
